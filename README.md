# Yellowstone-Application
The purpose of this program was to organize all the water data from an ongoing research project taking place in the Yellowstone National Park. This data was collected over many years, using several methods, and needed to be compiled into one place, with ease of access in order to maintain efficiency. The program needed to be an online web application so that researchers from several departments could access all the collected data without needing to have the data files on their own computers. Should the user want the data on their own machine, they can easily download the data from the server. Now the data will be consistent across departments, easily visualized, and only a click away.
